1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,560
come on

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,679
cars have always been a part of my

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,660
photography especially when I'm making

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,180
landscape photos within a city they end

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,820
up making their way into the photos a

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,980
lot of the times and to me when this is

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,539
successful the car will actually

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,180
complement the landscape that it's

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,519
sitting in but I've personally never set

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,098
out with the specific intentions of

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,559
focusing on photographing a car and I

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
think my first serious opportunity to do

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,660
this was when Road and track magazine

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,059
recently reached out to me and asked me

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,239
to photograph the Corvette Z06 in the

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,700
desert so today I want to share some

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,640
behind the scenes of this shoot with the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,980
Corvette Z06 and share some of my

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
process behind photographing maybe one

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,780
of the coolest supercars to come out of

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,760
America in a very long time

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,840
this issue of rodent track magazine is

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,479
titled sacred ground and it's as much

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,900
about the cars as it is about the places

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,820
that are important to cars and car

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,700
enthusiasts and so for the Corvette Z06

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,040
I would be photographing it on the roads

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,920
of Anza Borrego where this car was

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,860
actually developed and perfected by

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,439
Aaron link who's the GM development

31
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,780
driver and he would be joining us on the

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,880
shoot as well before we get into the

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,140
shoot I want to share a little bit of

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,659
the planning and the pre-production that

35
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,640
goes into a project like this there's

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,200
two things I'll usually do I'll go on

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,540
Google Maps street view to find

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,240
interesting looking key points or

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,060
interesting overlooks and then to find

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,640
interesting like twisty roads I'll go on

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,680
Google Maps and just look at the shape

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,140
of the road itself find some nice curves

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,420
and see if there are any Vantage points

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,820
to photograph the car from in terms of

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,159
equipment I would be bringing my Mamiya

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,420
rz67 and my Mia 7 as a backup which as

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,160
you'll see in the video I'm very glad I

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,099
did bring a backup then finally I have

49
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,920
my digital camera just to test my flash

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,260
shots and to preview some images

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,340
foreign

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,980
all right

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I really like the blue colors that are

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,560
going on from this early morning glow

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,780
especially with the orange car in there

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,120
it just complements each other very

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
nicely

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,680
foreign

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,580
we just shot some foggy photos of the

60
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,720
Corvette

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,000
uh like at the first light and now we're

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,040
at this beautiful viewpoint

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,780
to hopefully get some more photos of it

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,239
I'm really winging it because I'm

65
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,120
absolutely not a car photographer but

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,680
we're gonna see what we can make of it

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
here the light looks incredible and I

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,220
think if we just put the car in the good

69
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,080
light we'll get good photos so that's

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,540
the plan we're coming up to a Viewpoint

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,140
now the rz67 already crapped out on the

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,060
shoot it already decided to stop working

73
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,180
thank you

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,280
foreign with my flash here quite a bit

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
to kind of create some visual interest

76
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,860
different from the sunny images just to

77
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,360
give the editor something to play with

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,419
in the edit of the magazine create some

79
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,820
visually different looking images flash

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,620
is a great way to do that and there was

81
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,080
one flash shot in particular that stood

82
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,060
out to me which was actually a digital

83
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
photo of the interior of the car and it

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,820
really lit up the interior perfectly in

85
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,220
this like clinical way that shows like

86
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,199
the beautiful details of the stitching

87
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,780
and at the same time balanced with the

88
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,120
natural light is kind of this nice

89
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,360
mountainous landscape out the window and

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,639
I think this is a great shot because it

91
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,500
shows the interior but it also gets you

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,380
excited for these sacred roads that you

93
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,639
can see just out the window

94
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,380
thank you

95
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,220
foreign

96
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,680
s for the shoot was to have a lot of

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
motion in it so that the images really

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
had the feeling of driving the Z06 and

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,759
this was a real challenge for me

100
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,340
especially shooting on film I shot

101
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,580
anywhere between a 15th of a second and

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,039
a 60th of a second when I was trying to

103
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,560
get a motion blurry shot in the end this

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,660
just took quite a lot of film to commit

105
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,120
to getting that motion blur shot perfect

106
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,639
but in the end I think it was worth it

107
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,340
there's one shot specifically that I

108
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
think is my favorite from the whole

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,620
shoot where the Z06 is just moving

110
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,600
enough you can see the wheels are

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
spinning but the car is sharp and this

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,460
like gorgeous mountain landscape in the

113
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,220
background is slightly blurry but just

114
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,380
sharp enough I love the way this image

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,860
turned out

116
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,880
thank you

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
this was also a spot where we took some

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,259
portraits of Aaron Lincoln as I

119
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,419
mentioned before is the development

120
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,720
driver for GM he actually perfected this

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,759
car on these roads so to be able to

122
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,039
photograph him here with the car was

123
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,380
really special I used my flash in these

124
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,479
images and I got him sitting in the car

125
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,699
with the door open through the window

126
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,560
just trying to get a little bit of

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,539
variety here and I like the way these

128
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,819
looked but ultimately my favorite

129
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,160
portrait of Aaron ended up being the one

130
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,620
that we shot just after this at lunch

131
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,199
time when we sat down in a cafe and I

132
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,900
snapped some candid flash photos of him

133
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,300
drinking some coffee and it just ended

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,400
up being such a natural looking photo

135
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,039
after lunch I hopped inside the car for

136
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,080
a nice drive because I knew I wanted to

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,120
get some photos of the landscape moving

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,460
through the front windshield and out the

139
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,000
windows

140
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,580
thank you

141
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,839
the last missing piece of the shoot is

142
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,240
something that's almost required on any

143
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,459
Automotive shoot which is a rolling shot

144
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,920
of the car basically tracking the car

145
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,380
from another vehicle and so I was

146
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,019
hanging out the sunroof of my car while

147
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,660
Jake my buddy was driving and we were

148
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,360
following the Corvette down these desert

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,880
roads and this is a great way to get the

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,940
car still in the frame with the wheels

151
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,000
moving and the landscape blurred as the

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,760
car is going by my favorite one ended up

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,380
being this one with kind of a

154
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,660
interesting angle to it and I don't

155
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,519
usually do this but I think in this case

156
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,040
it added some energy to the shot and

157
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
added the excitement that it needed the

158
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,120
magazine is out and it looks beautiful

159
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,459
in print I think this project was

160
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,279
largely a success because of the very

161
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,459
clear direction of the editor Cassidy at

162
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,220
Road and track the way she requested a

163
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,740
lot of motion in the shots and she asked

164
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,860
for an emphasis on these sacred places

165
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,740
just as much as she wanted photos of the

166
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,019
car it really was a dream project for me

167
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,959
getting to combine like just my love for

168
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
cars and photography in one project

169
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,300
something that's really exciting is I

170
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,279
think maybe the best video I've ever

171
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,339
made for YouTube is coming out in a week

172
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,640
or maybe 10 days on the Porsche YouTube

173
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,180
channel it's a video where I basically

174
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,100
photograph all things Porsche we go to

175
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,160
the museum they're factories their

176
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,680
workshops we drive cars out on the roads

177
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,260
of Germany and that'll be out in a week

178
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,000
or so I think that's going to wrap it up

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
for this video thank you guys so much

180
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,180
